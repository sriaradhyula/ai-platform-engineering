# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains automated workflows for the AI Platform Engineering project.

## Available Workflows

See the `.github/workflows/` directory for the full list of CI/CD workflows.

### Manual mirror build

Use **[Release] Build All Images and Helm Charts** (`release-all-manual.yml`)
to create a mirror release and publish every image workflow and both local
charts from one immutable revision. Provide a version such as
`1.0.0-outshift.1`; the workflow updates all `Chart.yaml` files and local chart
dependency references, commits and tags the release, then dispatches the child
publishers from that tag. For an `-outshift.N` tag, Python metadata uses the
PEP 440 equivalent `+outshift.N`. When the target GHCR namespace differs from
the default `cisco-eti` namespace, set `repo_org` to that namespace. The
workflow dispatches the local `helm.yml` publisher with `publish_all=true` and
passes the same namespace to the image workflows.

## General Information

### Monitoring Workflows

View workflow runs:
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select the workflow you want to monitor
3. View logs for detailed execution information

### Common Issues & Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Workflow fails at checkout step
- Verify the repository URL and branch names are correct
- Check that the repository is accessible

**Issue**: Permission denied when pushing to ghcr.io
- Verify that the repository has package write permissions enabled
- Go to Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions
- Select "Read and write permissions"

**Issue**: Build command fails
- Check that the correct runtime versions are being used (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Verify the build commands match what's in package.json or project files
- Review build logs for specific error messages

**Issue**: Dockerfile not found
- Ensure the Dockerfile exists at the expected path
- Update the `file` parameter in the Docker build step to point to the correct location

### Security Best Practices

All workflows in this repository follow security best practices:
- ✅ Uses GitHub's OIDC token for authentication (no long-lived credentials)
- ✅ Generates attestations for supply chain security (where applicable)
- ✅ Implements build caching for faster subsequent builds
- ✅ Multi-platform builds ensure compatibility across architectures
- ✅ Minimal permissions granted via `permissions` blocks
- ✅ No secrets hardcoded in workflow files

### Adding New Workflows

To add a new workflow:

1. **Create workflow file**: Create a new `.yml` file in `.github/workflows/`
2. **Define triggers**: Specify when the workflow should run (push, PR, schedule, etc.)
3. **Add jobs and steps**: Define what the workflow should do
4. **Set permissions**: Grant only necessary permissions
5. **Test locally**: Use tools like [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test locally
6. **Document**: Add documentation to this README
7. **Update docs**: Add relevant documentation to `docs/docs/changes/`

### Workflow File Structure

```yaml

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: make test
