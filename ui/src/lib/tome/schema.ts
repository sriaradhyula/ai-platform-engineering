_The core customer problem, in 2-4 sentences: what pain exists, for whom, and why it is unsolved or poorly solved today. Include a short profile of who has this problem._
<!-- Confluence project/venture space -> overview, brief, or kickoff page. Fallback: GitHub repo README (top section) or Webex space pinned messages / early discussion. If not found, output "TBD -- problem statement not located in sources." -->

## Why Now
_Why this is worth doing at this moment: the timing driver (industry shift, technology maturity, competitive window, or pull from a BU/customer). One short paragraph._
<!-- Confluence brief/kickoff or a strategy/thesis page; Webex space discussion of rationale. If not found, output "TBD -- timing rationale not captured." -->

## Alignment
_How this work advances its parent, and which delivery window it serves._

- _Alignment rationale: how this contributes to the Area and BHAG it belongs to (draw the parent names from system metadata; explain the fit, do not just restate the linkage)._
- _Window: is this Market Making (Why/What, ~9+ months out) or Market Serving (How/When, ~6 months out), or a mix? State which, and briefly why._
<!-- Parent Area/BHAG names come from system metadata. Alignment reasoning and MM/MS designation: Confluence strategy page or venture proposal; Webex leadership/CL discussion. If not found, output "TBD -- alignment rationale not captured" and "Window: TBD (MM / MS / mixed)." -->

## Scope, Assumptions & Boundaries
_What this effort covers, what it assumes to be true, and where its edges are._

- _In scope: the problems, deliverables, or capabilities this effort owns._
- _Out of scope: what is deliberately NOT being built or addressed. Be explicit -- this prevents drift and wrong assumptions._
- _Assumptions & boundaries: what is currently believed about the problem, the environment, and this entity's autonomy -- the conditions under which the charter holds._
<!-- Confluence charter/proposal page; T3 proposal fields (problem, assumptions + boundaries). GitHub milestones/issues can indicate in-scope work. If not found, output "TBD" under each of the three bullets. -->

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
_Who this is for and what is understood about their world._

- _Target personas: roles and their demographic / technographic profile (e.g., "service-provider network engineer", "healthcare IT lead")._
- _Current market understanding: the state of the space and where it is heading._
- _Use cases: the concrete situations in which the ICP would adopt or benefit._
- _Customer research insights: what has been learned directly from design partners or prospects._
<!-- Confluence research/ICP pages, design-partner notes; Webex design-partner channels for research insights. At BHAG level this is broad; at T3 level it is specific. If not found, output "TBD" per bullet. -->

## Goals
_What success looks like, as concrete outcomes rather than activities. What state of the world means this effort has won._
<!-- Confluence charter/OKR page; venture proposal "outcome / exit condition". If not found, output "TBD -- success outcomes not defined." -->

## KPIs
_The measurable indicators for the goals above. For each: metric, target value, and time frame. Include a baseline (before value) where known._

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Time frame |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |

// system metadata and is NOT restated in the body. Time axis convention: the
// fiscal year runs Aug 1 - Jul 31. Quarters map as: Q1 = Aug-Oct, Q2 = Nov-Jan,
// Q3 = Feb-Apr, Q4 = May-Jul. FY numbering follows the ending calendar year
// (e.g., FY26 = Aug'25-Jul'26, so Q4 FY26 = May-Jul'26 and Q1 FY27 =
// Aug-Oct'26). Decompose to months where useful (e.g., "Jul'26"). Roadmap and
// execution-plan content may live in GitHub (e.g., ROADMAP.md / PLAN.md,
// wiki, docs/, project boards, milestones, issues) as well as in Confluence
// and Webex -- treat GitHub as a first-class roadmap source, not only a
// source of code artifacts.

## Milestones
_The dated outcomes that define progress, ordered by target date. Each milestone is an outcome or goal (not a task), tied to a time window, with the signal that proves it was met. Include the delivery window (Market Making or Market Serving) and current status._

| Milestone | Target (Qtr / Month) | Outcome & Success Signal | MM/MS | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
<!-- Confluence roadmap page and quarterly-goals ("Broad Roadmap Intent") pages; GitHub milestones for dates and completion state; Webex planning threads.

Status is one of: Not started / In progress / At risk / Blocked / Done. If none found, keep the header row and one empty row, and output "TBD -- milestones not defined." -->

## Delivery Plan
_The concrete deliverables that ladder up to the milestones above, grouped by workstream/component. For each: what it is, which milestone it supports, its target date, its release type, owner, and status. This is the detailed layer -- expect it to be rich at T3 level and lighter at BHAG/Area level._

| Deliverable | Workstream | Target Date | Release Type | Supports Milestone | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
<!-- GitHub (release tags, milestones, issues, project boards) for deliverables, dates, and status; Confluence deliverables/wiki pages. Release Type is one of: OSS (open source) / CSS (closed source) / Prototype / Paper / Demo / Spec. Status is one of: Not started / In progress / At risk / Blocked / Done -- put an ETA in the status cell for in-progress items. If none found, keep the header row and one empty row, and output "TBD -- deliverables not defined." -->

## Progress Summary
_A short narrative of current health: what has shipped since the last update, what is on track, what has slipped or is at risk (and why), and any change in dates. Two to five sentences._
<!-- Compare current status against the previous roadmap version; GitHub closed vs. open milestones/issues since last update; Webex status updates. If no prior state exists, summarize current status from the tables above. If nothing found, output "TBD -- no progress data available." -->

## Dependencies & Open Questions
_Cross-team or external dependencies that gate this roadmap, and the unresolved questions that could change it. State each dependency as "X depends on Y" and each question with why it matters and who owns the answer._
<!-- Confluence roadmap notes; Webex planning discussions; GitHub issues labeled dependency/blocked. If not found, output "None identified." -->

If not found, keep the header row and one empty row, and output "TBD -- roster not defined." -->

## Leadership & Decision Responsibility
_Who leads this team and who carries decision responsibility. At Area level, name the P-E pair that holds decision responsibility within the pod. At BHAG level, note that there is no explicit pod lead and name the four functional owners. State each clearly as "Name -- role -- decides on X."_

_People who advise this team but are not accountable members and are not counted in the team's core size. For each: name and the area they advise on._
