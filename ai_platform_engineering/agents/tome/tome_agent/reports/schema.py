"""Wiki page schema + frontmatter helpers.

A report version is a tree of markdown pages, addressable by path under

frontmatter. Stable pages are agent-drafted once at founding, then human-owned
— the autonomous ingest loop only preserves them; humans edit them directly or

<!-- Confluence project/venture space -> overview, brief, or kickoff page. Fallback: GitHub repo README (top section) or Webex space pinned messages / early discussion. If not found, output "TBD -- problem statement not located in sources." -->

## Why Now
_Why this is worth doing at this moment: the timing driver (industry shift, technology maturity, competitive window, or pull from a BU/customer). One short paragraph._
<!-- Confluence brief/kickoff or a strategy/thesis page; Webex space discussion of rationale. If not found, output "TBD -- timing rationale not captured." -->

## Alignment
_How this work advances its parent, and which delivery window it serves._

- _Alignment rationale: how this contributes to the Area and BHAG it belongs to (draw the parent names from system metadata; explain the fit, do not just restate the linkage)._
- _Window: is this Market Making (Why/What, ~9+ months out) or Market Serving (How/When, ~6 months out), or a mix? State which, and briefly why._

_What this effort covers, what it assumes to be true, and where its edges are._

- _Out of scope: what is deliberately NOT being built or addressed. Be explicit -- this prevents drift and wrong assumptions._

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
_Who this is for and what is understood about their world._

- _Target personas: roles and their demographic / technographic profile (e.g., "service-provider network engineer", "healthcare IT lead")._
- _Current market understanding: the state of the space and where it is heading._
- _Use cases: the concrete situations in which the ICP would adopt or benefit._
- _Customer research insights: what has been learned directly from design partners or prospects._
<!-- Confluence research/ICP pages, design-partner notes; Webex design-partner channels for research insights. At BHAG level this is broad; at T3 level it is specific. If not found, output "TBD" per bullet. -->

## KPIs
_The measurable indicators for the goals above. For each: metric, target value, and time frame. Include a baseline (before value) where known._
