"""Ingest surface — Claude Agent SDK loop, streams IngestEventPayloads
back to the backend as SSE.

The backend POSTs an `IngestRequest` containing the project snapshot,
pre-resolved `connector_data`, the pre-created `report_id`, and the
greenfield/incremental flag. The agent runs the loop, emitting SSE
events for log lines, tool calls, page writes, and the final result.
The backend re-emits these as `IngestRun.log` lines, finalizes the
`Report` row on `done`, and owns the post-run `reconcile_from_disk`
(it holds sqlite + the FS mount).
