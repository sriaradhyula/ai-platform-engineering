response the SDK externalized to a tool-results file it can't otherwise

by the SDK, so there's no separate field to carry an override flag; the
marker rides on the one string field these tools do take, the same way a
shell command can be prefixed with `VAR=1 &&`. Deliberately narrow: only
widens the READ sandbox, never the separate Write/Edit/Bash restrictions
(Bash stays banned outright — see `make_deny_unsafe_tools_hook` for why).

MUST start with `/`: the model/CLI resolves a relative-looking file_path
against cwd before our hook ever sees it (confirmed in production — a
non-`/`-prefixed marker arrived at the hook already rejoined onto the
project dir, e.g. `/project/<id>/TOME_AGENT_OVERRIDE_BLOCK=1::/etc/hostname`,
which silently passed the sandbox check as a bogus in-tree path and 404'd
on the real Read instead of ever exercising the override). Keeping the
marker itself absolute means `{MARKER}{real_absolute_path}` is still one
