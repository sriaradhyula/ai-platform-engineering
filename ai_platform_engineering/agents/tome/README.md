# Tome Agent

The LLM "brain" for the **Tome** wiki app (the UI shell lives in `ui/src` under
`lib/tome`, `components/tome`, `app/api/tome`). caipe-ui is LLM-free by design,
so all model work is delegated to this Python service over HTTP/SSE — the same
pattern the platform uses for the supervisor and dynamic agents.

It runs the **Claude Agent SDK** ingest + chat loops. The UI proxies
`POST /chat`, `POST /ingest`, `POST /presentation`, and `POST /evaluate` to it; the agent calls back to the UI's
`/api/tome/api/internal/...` endpoints for the project snapshot, page bodies,
and persistence. CAIPE Mongo is the system of record.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/chat` | Chat turn → `text/event-stream` (`token`/`tool_call`/`tool_result`/`session`/`done`/`error`) |
| POST | `/ingest` | Ingest run → `text/event-stream` (`log`/`tool_call`/`page_written`/`done`/`error`) |
| POST | `/evaluate` | Blinded, structured claim and fidelity evaluation against frozen evidence |
| POST | `/presentation` | Toolless generation or revision of a structured, source-grounded slide deck |
| POST | `/presentation/stream` | SSE stream of deck generation followed by the validated editable deck |
| POST | `/presentation/requirements/stream` | SSE stream of AI Assist output followed by a validated editable brief |
| POST | `/model-check` | Toolless smoke test for an administrator-selected model id |
| GET | `/healthz` · `/readyz` · `/metrics` | Liveness / readiness / metrics |

## Configuration (env)

| Var | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `TTT_PROJECT_ID` | CAIPE project id/slug (opaque; used to build callback URLs) |
| `TTT_BACKEND_URL` | Base for the UI's tome API, e.g. `http://caipe-ui:3000/api/tome` |
| `TTT_AGENT_TOKEN` | Shared bearer for the internal callbacks (non-empty) |
| `TTT_PROJECT_ROOT` | Working-copy dir for the agent's file tools (rehydrated each run) |
| `TTT_AGENT_ROLE` | `editor` \| `viewer` |
| `TTT_CHAT_MODEL` / `TTT_INGEST_MODEL` / `TTT_PRESENTATION_MODEL` | Deployment fallback model ids when no exact/type/global setting exists |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic-style endpoint + key (a proxy may front Bedrock etc.) |
| `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` / `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` | Langfuse project credentials; tracing is enabled when both are present |
| `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` | Langfuse server URL, e.g. `https://langfuse.example.com` |
| `LANGFUSE_TRACING_ENABLED` | Optional kill switch; defaults to `true` when Langfuse credentials are configured |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `CONFLUENCE_TOKEN` / `WEBEX_TOKEN` | Read-only source tokens for the connector MCPs (optional) |

The endpoint, models, and credentials are config-driven — nothing host- or
product-specific is hardcoded. Model resolution is exact entity, entity type,
global, environment, then built-in fallback. `TTT_CHAT_MODEL` backs chat and
is also the presentation fallback when `TTT_PRESENTATION_MODEL` is unset;
`TTT_INGEST_MODEL` backs ingest, synthesis, and compaction;
`TTT_PRESENTATION_MODEL` backs PowerPoint generation and revision.

### Langfuse tracing

Tome uses the Claude Agent SDK, and the optional OpenInference Claude Agent SDK
instrumentation captures each agent run, Claude generation, and SDK tool call.
It is initialized before the FastAPI service accepts requests, so all existing
SDK entry points are covered without changing their prompts or tool policies.
Tracing is fail-open: missing credentials or an initialization error is logged
and does not prevent Tome from serving requests.

For a self-hosted Langfuse deployment, set `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` to the server
URL and inject project credentials through the deployment secret. Do not put
the keys in the image, repository, or a checked-in `.env` file. For short-lived
processes, call `langfuse.flush()` after the final agent run; the HTTP service
flushes queued spans during graceful shutdown.

## Experiment isolation

Experiment requests carry an experiment id, artifact id, candidate model, seed, turn limit, and a
frozen evidence bundle. The agent reconstructs the workspace from that bundle and disables live
connector, web, feed, and TOME MCP tools. Page-write callbacks include both ids; the UI routes them to
the experiment artifact collection instead of the live page store. The evaluator receives a blind
label and evidence hashes, never the candidate model identity.

## Run (local dev)

```bash
uv run uvicorn tome_agent.agent.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8766
```

Point the UI at it with `TOME_AGENT_URL` (e.g. `http://host.docker.internal:8766`).
