# LiteLLM MCP Server

This package exposes a read-only MCP interface for the CAIPE LiteLLM proxy at
`https://litellm.prod.outshift.ai`.

The server was generated with
[`cnoe-io/openapi-mcp-codegen`](https://github.com/cnoe-io/openapi-mcp-codegen)
from the LiteLLM OpenAPI document for version `1.83.10`, using a curated set of
GET endpoints for management, inventory, health, spend, audit, and usage data.

## Setup

Create an MCP environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.mcp
```

Then set a LiteLLM admin or read-capable proxy token:

```bash
LITELLM_API_URL=https://litellm.prod.outshift.ai
LITELLM_API_KEY=
LITELLM_API_TIMEOUT=120
LITELLM_VERIFY_SSL=true
SERVER_NAME=LITELLM
```

`LITELLM_TOKEN` and `LITELLM_API_TOKEN` are also accepted as compatibility aliases.
`LITELLM_API_TIMEOUT` is optional and defaults to 30 seconds. Use a larger value
for slower analytics endpoints such as spend logs.

## Running

Run with the shared MCP Makefile in stdio mode:

```bash
make run
```

Run in streamable HTTP mode:

```bash
make run MCP_MODE=HTTP MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 MCP_PORT=18080
```

The direct uv entrypoint is also available:

```bash
uv run mcp-litellm
```

## Helm Deployment

The parent `ai-platform-engineering` chart can deploy this MCP server as a
standalone Kubernetes service. Enable it with Helm values, then point CAIPE UI
at the in-cluster service.

Use the canonical image repositories for every lifecycle. Select a temporary
prebuild or released artifact with the tag only:

```yaml
litellmMcp:
  enabled: true
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/caipe-io/mcp-litellm
    tag: "<prebuild-or-release-tag>"
  config:
    LITELLM_API_URL: "https://litellm.prod.outshift.ai"
    LITELLM_API_TIMEOUT: "120"
    LITELLM_VERIFY_SSL: "true"
  existingSecret: "litellm-mcp-secret"

dynamic-agents:
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/caipe-io/caipe-dynamic-agents
    tag: "<prebuild-or-release-tag>"

caipe-ui:
  appConfig:
    mcp_servers:
      - id: litellm
        name: LiteLLM
        description: LiteLLM FinOps reporting tools
        transport: http
        endpoint: http://ai-platform-engineering-litellm-mcp:8000/mcp
        enabled: true
```

If the Helm release name is not `ai-platform-engineering`, update the endpoint
host to match the rendered LiteLLM MCP Service name.

Create `litellm-mcp-secret` with:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic litellm-mcp-secret \
  --from-literal=LITELLM_API_KEY='<token>'
```

In shared clusters, prefer External Secrets or the platform secret manager
instead of creating the Secret by hand.

## Tools

The server registers the generated read-only tools plus curated report helpers.
Use the curated helpers for agent-facing analytics so the agent does not try to
infer full reports from one raw page of spend logs.

Curated tools:

- `get_llm_token_usage_report` - returns token totals plus top models and users
  for a month, a two-month custom range, or a CAIPE business quarter.
- `get_llm_spend_by_model_report` - returns spend per model for a month, a
  two-month custom range, or a CAIPE business quarter.
- `get_llm_usage_and_spend_by_user_report` - returns token usage and spend per
  user, including each user's top models.
- `get_llm_top_models_report` and `get_llm_usage_by_user_report` - compatibility
  aliases for older FinOps prompts.

The curated reports use LiteLLM's aggregate `/user/daily/activity/aggregated`
endpoint month-by-month instead of raw paginated spend logs. Custom date ranges
are limited to two calendar months. Quarter reports use the CAIPE business
quarters: Aug-Oct, Nov-Jan, Feb-Apr, and May-Jul.

Fiscal-year periods are also supported. The fiscal year runs from August 1
through July 31 and is named by the calendar year in which it ends. For example,
FY26 is August 1, 2025 through July 31, 2026:

- `FY26Q1` - August 1, 2025 through October 31, 2025
- `FY26Q2` - November 1, 2025 through January 31, 2026
- `FY26Q3` - February 1, 2026 through April 30, 2026
- `FY26Q4` - May 1, 2026 through July 31, 2026

Each curated report also includes a `visualizations` object with:

- `chart_data` - chart-ready bar data for top models/users.
- `text_charts` - ASCII bar charts that can be pasted directly into chat.
- `downloadable_reports` - Markdown, HTML, and CSV report templates. The FinOps agent
  can pass these `content` values to `write_file` so users can download reports
  from the existing Files section without requiring CAIPE UI chart changes.
- `files_to_write` and `file_write_status` - top-level guidance that reminds the
  FinOps agent that report templates are not visible in Grid until it calls
  `write_file`. By default, write every file in `files_to_write` so users get
  the visual HTML report and the CSV export. For HTML-only requests, pass
  `report_format: "html"` and then write the returned `/reports/*.html` entry
  before sending the final answer.
- `recommended_report_file` - the default visual HTML report with inline SVG
  graphs. FinOps agents should write this file for every report request, even
  when the user asks for a report without explicitly asking for graphs.
- `csv_report_file` - the default CSV export for spreadsheet-style analysis.
- `recommended_report_files` - the primary visual HTML report plus the CSV
  export. FinOps agents can iterate over this list when they only need the
  default downloads.

Recommended FinOps agent prompt rules:

- When asked "what can you do?", mention LiteLLM token reports, spend per
  LLM/model, user-level usage and spend, top model usage, available model
  inventory, downloadable HTML reports with visualization charts, and CSV
  exports. Mention supported fiscal periods such as `FY26Q1`.
- For every report request, call the relevant curated LiteLLM report tool with
  `report_format: "all"` unless the user explicitly asks for a single format.
- After the report tool returns, call `write_file` for every item in
  `files_to_write` so the HTML chart report and CSV export appear in Grid Files
  by default.
- Only say the reports are available in Files after every `write_file` call
  succeeds.

The generated server registers 110 read-only tools, including:

- model and model group inventory
- key, user, team, organization, project, and customer lookup
- spend, tag, budget, and provider budget views
- health, cache, callback, and router status
- guardrail and policy usage summaries
- prompt, search tool, audit, and configuration views
